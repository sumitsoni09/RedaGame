# RedaGame
A app that users can review and update ratings for video games

My app is suppose to give multiple users to create their own list of games either the ones they like, want, or buy and will have a top 20 games for best selling as the home page.

The troubles I have faced for making this app is for hiding the native nav bar when a user has signed in, and to have the logout button to work so the user can revert back to the home page.

The things that I am proud of for making this this site is to have the header bar and background to stay by a fixed position like so.

header {
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(black, red);
}

While working with the CSS I also fell in love with the semantic css framework and used it mostly on coloring my buttons. I didn't really find the containers helpful from the framework for my project, but would love to use it again.
